I am now a 3rd-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering at Hunan University, supervised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/zhangchao). I joined Prof. Zhangâ€™s UNSAT lab in 2022 as a 3-rd year undergraduate student.

My passion lies in advancing the intelligent driving of shield machines for tunneling engineering. I integrate unsaturated soil mechanics, machine learning, and multibody dynamics to advance the intelligent control of shield/underground tunneling robots in complex strata. Recently, I have focused on developing a control-oriented dynamics modeling approach for shield machines operating in deformable media.

In the UNSAT lab, I belong to a five-member group focusing on intelligent construction of underground space. I work closely with the other four members: Yangkai Gong, Du Han, Yi Dai, and Guodong Wu, who are the most incredible, talented, and beautiful partners ever.

Please find my publication list [here](https://yuzhang-unsat.github.io) or through [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-1216/research). Feel free to communicate about research works via **zhangyu10@hnu.edu.cn** or **Wechat: wxid_is9rr3un7n8r22**.
